Run Jam
Safe Running Route and Playlist Generator

This application will help users find the safest running routes in their area based on crime statistics from publicly available datasets (e.g., FBI crime data). Users will log in using third-party authentication (e.g., Facebook OAuth), and the app will store their profile and running preferences in a database. Based on the user's desired running time and location, the app will generate a safe running route and create a Spotify playlist tailored to the length and style of the run. This ensures that users can enjoy a safe and musically enjoyable workout experience.

- Safe running routes based on real-time crime data to ensure user safety.
- Custom Spotify playlists that match the duration and intensity of their run.
- A seamless integration of safety and entertainment for a more enjoyable running experience.
