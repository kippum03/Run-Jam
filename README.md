Poke Jam
Pokémon-Themed Playlist Generator

This application will allow users to generate Spotify playlists based on their favorite Pokémon. Users will log in using third-party authentication (e.g., Google OAuth), and the app will store their profile and preferences in a database. By leveraging the Spotify API and PokeAPI, the application will correlate the user's favorite Pokémon characteristics with music genres and moods to create custom playlists. This ensures that users can enjoy a personalized music experience based on their Pokémon preferences.
